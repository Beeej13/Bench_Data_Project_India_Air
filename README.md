# Bench_Data_Project_India_Air

## Project Brief

Due to the recent success of the JWC and Xander Talent HR collaboration, JWC has decided to poach you from Xander Talent and offer you a permanent managerial role. JWC believe that opening a Data Analytics department will prove to be beneficial in the long term. They do not yet have the expertise on what positions will be required with this department to take-off. You’re first assignment at JWC is to spearhead the development of this new Data Analytics department. You will be tasked with recruiting a new team from scratch, however, there are several constraints that need to be taken into consideration before you can begin:
1.	The team must consist of a minimum of three members.
2.	You have a budget cap of 16,449,200 Indian Rupees. (~$200k per year) 

As manager of the team, you will be given free rein on how many new employees you want to hire and which roles you decide to bring into the company. However, before the team is signed off, you will need to present to your director the various roles you want to introduce into the department and why these decisions have been made. 

## Part Two A

With the successful launch of your Analytics team, you and your team have been given your first assignment. You have obtained a large dataset containing information on the past 25 years of the air quality of India, specifically Andhra Pradesh. JWC want you to drill-down and assess the severity of the situation. They want to find out the current state of the various cities and the certain challenges they may face. You are also expected to investigate if this lifestyle is sustainable going forward. What changes may need to be made to reverse the negative impact India is facing with its air quality crisis.

Data Analyst/Business Change – You will be required to report your findings to the team. Use the data to convey the gravity of what is happening over time. 

Data Science/Engineer – You will be required to model the future state of Andhra Pradesh over the next 10 years. Using this or another model, determine which point in time will be the point of no return?

## Part Two B 

Data Science: In light of your recent findings, there doesn’t appear to be a concrete point in time where the quality is unrecoverable. Nonetheless, construct your model(s) based on what you expect the air quality to be like in Andhra Pradesh 25 years from now.

Data Analysis: You have been tasked to do further research on the macro state pollutants in India. Using your existent findings, highlights areas/states that are showing improvements (2A) and areas that are in decline. Highlight the top 5 and bottom 5 areas bases on these findings. As consultants, you are responsible for illuminating the data. You can use external resources to corroborate your arguments. This won’t require the modelling, but you will still need to provide a concise argument.


## Tips
### Requirements Gathering
The start to any project is to make sure you have clear and well-defined requirements for your project. Most projects start with a vague idea of what the stakeholder wants, and as a consultant, we will never have as much knowledge about their problem/business context as they do. Therefore, we need to get as much information out of them as possible, as they will subconsciously assume that we know everything. 
For this project, Stephen Cole & Alex Naylor will be the stakeholders.

If you don't know the answer to any question then you should always ask - NEVER ASSUME. This will only risk the accuracy of your work and end up having to do everything all over again if you wrongly assume.

Questions to ask yourself constantly throughout the project are:

What is the purpose of this project, why does the stakeholder want this and what is the desired outcome of the project?

Is there any extra info that the stakeholder could tell you to help tailor the project to what they want?

Questions more specifically for Data Science:

Are there any features that I could create to improve the model?
What machine learning models are applicable to the project's target?
Is the target feature for my model correct?
If you do not know the answer or are unsure, then I highly recommend asking the stakeholders.
